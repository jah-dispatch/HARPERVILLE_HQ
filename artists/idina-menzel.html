        Oh my God. Miss Menzel has been a part of my adoration for music ever since 2007. I remember distinctly, having just moved back to Salt Lake City to live with my oldest brother and his then-bitchy wife, the very day after my High School graduation. Mind you, I never did have the fortunate ability to go see "Wicked" on Broadway, neither the original cast or re-casted roles entirely. But the soundtrack? God bless Stephen Schwartz and the entire team for such excellent storytelling that kept my heart from crumbling under the unbearable weight of missing my mother. In fact, it was the "Wicked" Broadway Cast soundtrack that got me through 6 full hours of bus commuting 5x/week because I lived in Kearns, but worked one of the most stressful jobs in my entire life all the way in downtown SLC. Tracks like "No Good Deed" and "For Good" brought me more than healing. Those words, echoed by the angelic tone of Idina Menzel (and Kristin Chenoweth) which kept my spirits elevated so I could continue 'defying gravity' amidst a sea of uncaring, rude, contemptuous Mormons whom (without fail) always gave me the side-eye in a grocery store or mall corridor. But, it was only <em>then</em> when I even <strong>began</strong> to realize my life story shared an uncanny resemblance to that of Elphaba Thropp. So, in many ways, it's Miss Menzel who's responsible for my Salt Lake City survival—and I'll never forget the way she made me feel every morning and evening.
