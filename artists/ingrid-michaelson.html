        Now, I know <em>for sure</em> that Shonda Rhimes is responsible for having introduced this songbird into my world. "Keep Breathing" is the track that did it for me, premiering at the Season 3 Finale—one of GA's most penultimate moments of all twenty-something seasons. And much like a tasty, palatable wine, time evolved Ingrid's sound into something more remarkable than her debut work. It's albums such as "Stranger Things" and "Be Okay" that deliver a heart full of song, yet the two albums themselves take on completely different themes entirely. This distinction is what shapes the emotional and prolific arc of a truly versatile, amazing artist. I don't ever have the chances to catch Broadway productions, but "The Notebook" would be something I'd choose to see first if I ever <em>DID</em> have the opportunity to see it up front and center.
