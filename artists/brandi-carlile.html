        Brandi, Brandi, Brandi. It's all just turpentime and <em>clock-tick</em> glances. She's the showrunner in my "Dead Mom Era" as I recollect memories from the night I witnessed my mother take her last breaths. Long, cavernous hours. And yet, the only thing I could find myself doing was glancing at the clock hoping it was all just a really bad dream. And the track "What Can I Say" will forever remain my most favorite song from their entire discography. If not for "Heart's Content" in 2012, I'd not have found the courage to start dipping my toes in the dating pool. Between the "Wicked" Broadway recording soundtrack and Brandi Carlile, I've been encumbered with enough musical ammunition to weather any storm life rains down my path. Now, "The Story", in its infinite wisdom and narrated depth, originally performed by Brandi Carlile, I will unabashedly admit LeAnn Rimes delivered it best. But for a solid decade at least, it stood on its own and held the line with grand panache.
