        My love for Taylor Swift goes all the way back to my career as a pharmacy administrator. Cue Golden Girls' Sophia's storytelling marker: "Picture It... 2015..." Jack scurrying behind the pharmacy counter like the mad rabbit, wielding Amozicilin in one hand and a cellphone with Aetna Pharmacy Relations in the other. It's three days before Christmas and a pharmacy technician shouts, "Delaney got her wish!" — All of a sudden, everyone's instagram and facebook notifications ping with the force of a billion stars exploding at once. The news? This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtUGLOD3Ss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">special interest segment</a> here shows you a real class act!! I'd known OF Taylor Swift. I'd liked maybe two of her songs by that moment—nothing fanatical. But knowing one of our pharmacy patients who (God rest her soul) got to experience one of her only dying wishes. Who else in the celebrity-circuit do <em>you know of</em> who would drop everything they're doing to visit a dying girl merely a couple of days before Christmas? <strong>I'm gonna guess not that many.</strong> So, that is how I, Jack Aspen Harper, became a Swiftie. Because if she erased an entire day from her personal schedule to cheer up a fan (whom passed peacefully merely a couple months later), then I knew she was the type of artist I needed to start giving my support. Rest in sweet peace, Delaney Clements. The people who've diverged paths since the pharmacy crapstorm of 2016 full of corporate mergers, dissolutions, and layoffs? Well, we will always remember your bright spirit. And to Taylor, thank you so many years after the fact. It still means the world to me after all this time has gone by.
