      This is how I envision myself two years from now — grounded, creatively
      fulfilled, emotionally unflutterable, and living inside a life that
      finally fits. New York City? Beverly Hills? Portland? Honestly, I could see
      myself just about anywhere—EXCEPT Western Colorado.

    <p class="bio-text">
      Marcello W. — Italian, emotionally literate, impeccably dressed, and
      fully capable of handling Harperville energy without flinching.
      My future Daddy does NOT have to be Italian. Nor come from wealth.
      He will, and absolutely MUST be:
      Trauma Informed
      Emotionally Mature
      Patient
      A breadth of mental health understanding and acceptance.
      His name doesn't have to be Marcello. Somehow, my intuition tells me 
      that will be their name, or at least their first name will start with
      an 'M' and their last name a 'W'...

      A shared future built on intention, humor, mutual admiration, and the
      quiet confidence of choosing each other on purpose. This is the loving
      companionship I envision. We can travel, sure. But I'd be just as 
      smitten by staying in most nights, curled up with our hands intertwined,
      watching television or a movie. Possibilities, Possibilities, Possibilities!
