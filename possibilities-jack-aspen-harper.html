              Marcello W. — Italian, emotionally literate, impeccably dressed, and fully capable of handling Harperville energy without flinching. My future Daddy does NOT have to be Italian. Nor come from wealth. He will, and absolutely MUST be: Trauma Informed, Emotionally Mature, Patient. He must be armored with a breadth of mental health understanding and acceptance. His name doesn't have to be Marcello. Somehow, my intuition tells me that will be their name, or at least their first name will start with an 'M' and their last name a 'W'... even though Italian surnames don't actually start with that letter.

We can travel, sure. But I'd be just as smitten by staying in most nights, curled up with our hands intertwined, watching television or a movie. Possibilities, Possibilities, Possibilities!
