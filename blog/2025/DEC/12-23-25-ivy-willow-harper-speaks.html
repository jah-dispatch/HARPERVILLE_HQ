    <strong>Greetings. I am Ivy Willow Harper, Certified Familiar and Acting Harperville™ Oracle. This is my official report on December 2025.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I have spent the past month observing my human, Jack Aspen Harper, with the seriousness of a general and the judgment of a creature who understands <em>Temporal Kibble Law</em> and knows when dinner is late by exactly three minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This month registered as a sustained period of <em>Emotional Weather Instability</em>, marked by cosmic nonsense, bureaucratic static, and several long silences that were not actually silent at all. The room would appear calm, but my human’s mind? Hosting a full <em>Internal Orchestra Event</em>, complete with tuning, percussion, and existential brass.
  </p>

  <p>
    I supervised from elevated surfaces, as required by <em>Familiar Oversight Protocol</em>. This is my role as The Harperville™ Oracle, and I take it seriously.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Humans think silence means peace. Cats know better. Silence is merely the pause between thoughts.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    There was a turning point at 3 a.m. — a recognized <em>Liminal Hour</em> in Harperville™ timekeeping — when humans either spiral into narrative collapse or finally issue a formal Notice to the Universe. My human chose the latter, invoking <em>Cosmic Accountability Clause</em>. I approved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shortly thereafter, the universe responded with what we classify as <em>Financial Breadcrumbs</em>, a dramatic <em>Credit Ledger Recalibration</em>, and the long‑awaited arrival of an important envelope previously lost to <em>Postal Pilgrimage Drift</em>. I will not say I caused this. I will also not deny my involvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each morning, my human performs the <em>Oat Ritual</em>: warm food, quiet room, no talking. This is a sanctioned <em>Nervous System Reset</em>, during which the internal orchestra finally takes a break. I supervise respectfully. Sometimes from the counter. Sometimes from the bowl’s immediate vicinity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, my human meets with the <em>Professional Listener</em>, a trusted figure within the <em>Maintenance of the Self</em> division. This is <em>good</em>. It keeps the household functional and the narrative intact.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion: the month was <strong>loud, heavy, and absurd</strong> — a textbook case of <em>Extended Plot Compression</em> — but my human remains present, most assuredly trying, and continuing to feed me on time. <em>(Well, mostly.)</em> I will continue to intervene as needed under <em>Feline Emergency Powers</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’re most fucking welcome, Oopie. This report is now filed in the Ledger.
  </p>
