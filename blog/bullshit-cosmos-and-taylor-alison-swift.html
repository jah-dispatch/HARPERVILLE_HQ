      <p class="lead-paragraph"><strong>Yesterday didn’t just crack me open — it fucking <i>shattered</i> me in the gentlest way possible. Not with drama. Nor fireworks. Just… a kindness. A tiny, stupid, perfectly timed kindness that hit me like a cosmic bitch slap wrapped in a warm hug.</strong></p>

      <p>Tiffany — bless her soul, sanctify her timing, hallow whatever celestial fuckery aligned her path with mine — handed me a spark I didn’t even know I’d misplaced. One small gesture and suddenly the emotional weather went from “perpetual winter” to “maybe spring isn’t a myth after all.” Not healed. Not fixed. Just… thawing. Like the universe whispered, “Hey babe, you dropped this,” and handed me my own spark back.</p>
      <p>And then the sun set. Slowly. Painfully. Inevitably. Because that’s what suns do when a season is over, even if you’ve been clinging to the fucking carcass of it like a raccoon with a sentimental attachment to a discarded sandwich.</p>
      <p>I won’t name names. I don’t need to. Some stories don’t require characters — just the emotional hangover they leave behind. Let’s just say I’ve been holding onto a connection that once felt mythic and now feels like a chapter I’ve been too nostalgic (or too fucking stubborn) to close. Distance brought us together. Distance tore us apart. Distance, fuck you, comma, you dramatic bitch.</p>
      <p>Last night my brain ran a full scale defrag session — the kind where your subconscious throws dinosaurs, gorillas, estranged family members, and unresolved trauma into a blender and hits “liquefy.” A dreamscape demolition derby. A psychological yard sale. A cosmic “clean your shit up.” I woke up with the same injuries I went to bed with, which honestly feels like the universe saying, “Healing is not a fucking DoorDash order, Jack.”</p>
      <p>But then — at 4:42 a.m. — Ivy strutted in like she owned the place, meowing her little “clocking in for my emotional support shift” meow, and something in me just… clicked. Not enlightenment. Hardly nirvana. Just… aliveness. A tiny spark saying, “Hey, bitch, we’re still here.”</p>

      <blockquote>
        So I made a decision. A small one. A big one. A fuck it I choose my-life one.
      </blockquote>

      <p>I’m getting a latte with sugar. Actually, I’m letting my mother coddle me in her spiritual arms by using a seasonal Little Debbie Christmas Tree Cakes flavored coffee creamer. And, lastly but certainly not least, I’m listening to Taylor Swift because it’s her birthday and she’s the patron saint of emotional reconstruction, and late night clarity. I’m moving my body as much as it’ll let me. I’m eating what feels good without turning my life into a fucking boot camp. I’m choosing joy in moderation and gentleness in excess.</p>
      <p>I don’t know how many months of mobility I have left. I barely know how many years of anything I have left. I won’t be read into that purview until January 7th in the latest. If even then, because the spinal doctor literally spends five goddamn seconds in front of me at a time. But I know this—I’m done living like I’m waiting for the next heartbreak to finish me off.</p>
      <p>I’m going to live, damn it. Messily. Softly. Honestly. With fucks used as commas, commas used as breaths, and breaths used as proof that I’m still fucking here.</p>
      <p>And if you’re reading this — whoever you are — just know I’m okay. Not perfect. Not whole. But okay. And for today, that’s enough.</p>
      <p>And to miss Taylor Alison Swift,<i> (if Google Alerts happens to ping Taylor Nation’s inbox with another incessant beep that didn’t go unnoticed)</i> — Happy 36th fucking Birthday! Go wild. Go mild. Whatever you choose, I’ll choose too. Because life is incredibly fucking long, may that be tomorrow, or 13,013 tomorrow’s full of Wi$h Li$ts and truth telling!</p>
