      <p class="lead-paragraph"><strong>I’m a patient person — but I’m not a medical doormat.</strong></p>

      <p>I’ll wait my turn. I’ll follow the process. I’ll give people the benefit of the doubt. But there’s a difference between being patient and being <em>walked on</em>, and yesterday I finally hit the line between the two.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t even the delay that broke me — it was the <strong>vacation</strong>. Not the vacation itself, <em>(oh how this could be a topic for another day, and it will)</em> but the fact that nobody bothered to mention it when scheduling the follow-up to review my MRIs and develop a treatment plan. I was sitting here thinking, “Wow, he must be booked solid,” when in reality the professionally charming—yet internally sinsiter piece of human flesh—was probably packing sunscreen and deciding which Hawaiian golf courses to traverse. Meanwhile, my MRI results were sitting untouched, collecting virtual dust, like a sad little orphan file.</p>

      <p>And once I knew that? Oh, the sourness. I went full <strong>Warhead</strong>. Not explosive — just that sharp, involuntary, face‑twisting disgust that hits when you realize you’ve been waiting for absolutely no reason.</p>

      <p>But here’s the part that surprised me: therapy didn’t make me angrier. It didn’t feed the bitterness. It actually cracked something open in my chest in a way I wasn’t expecting. My therapist didn’t try to fix me. Well, okay she did. It's kind of her job to fix my thought logic. She didn’t try to talk me out of my feelings, though. And honestly, she just sat there — a body with a working brain — and let me talk in circles until I heard myself. And somewhere in the middle of my rant about Christmas dinners and cosmic inconvenience, something softened.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>I can be pissed without being poisoned. I can be patient without being passive. I can demand care without apologizing for needing it.</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I’m not a doormat. I’m not a problem. I’m a person who deserves to be taken seriously. And if that makes me a little sour sometimes? Good. At least it means I still have teeth.</p>
